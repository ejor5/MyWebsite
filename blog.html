                            <h3>Welcome to My Website Blog - 2/27/2025</h3>
                            <p>Welcome to my website blog! I have been working on this website for a few months, and I have officially purchased the domain and got the website in publishing functionality! I'm excited to share my journey, projects, and insights about technology and programming with you. Stay tuned for more updates and posts!</p>
                            <p>The creation of this website was a bit finnicky since I dreamt larger than I could afford. Initially this website had a video background of space as you see currently, but the cost for renting server space was too expensive for a college student. I looked into using an old computer to host my website, but with my background in security I understood the huge security risk that was and decided against it. GitHub pages offered limited but useful hosting, so that is what this is running on. I had initially built an interactive console that would be embedded into this website as a way to learn about me, but once again was limited by the constrictions of GitHub pages.</p>

                            <h3>Creation of Disneyland Live Stream App! 2/27/2025</h3>
                            <p>I have been wanting to make a linux based application that runs on my raspberry pi 3 for a long time, and the 24 hour Disneyland live stream seemed like a great opportunity. It took me about 2 weeks to fully develop since I have been so busy with school, here it is! I came across many difficulties trying to access the correct live stream from Howard Johnson, since the webcam creates a new stream at three different points throughout the day. To solve this problem, I thought outside of the box and used the solution of going to their website and pulling the link directly from them.</p>
                            <h3>Update 4/11/2025</h3>
                            <p>My raspberry pi really didn't have the RAM to run this application, so I went ahead an focused the application for Windows Based systems. You can run it now! Just click this post and it will take you to the GitHub. Download it and run DisneyDashboard.exe!</p>

                            <h3>Almaden Valley Athletic Club Web Scheduler 3/30/2025</h3>
                            <p>I work as a tennis scheduler at Almaden Valley Athletic club, and I have always hated painstakingly repeititve tasks. Each month, a tennis scheduler has to type in each student's name to enroll them. I decided to create a web scraping tool that would go through each class and each day, pull all names into a list, and sign them up for the next month automatically.</p>
                            <h3>Running the Program 7/25/2025</h3>
                            <p>I finally got the go-ahead for the AVAC Tennis Enrollment Project. It works wonderfully and I added new features. The main feature that I added was if a student's name was in the Tennis Inquiries CSV that I downloaded from our work computer, than the student would be flagged before enrollment, requiring user input from a Tennis Worker.</p>

                            <h3>Real Estate Internship 2022-2024</h3>
                            <p>Real estate has been a huge journey for me. I was taken under the wing of Jake Gipson, an eager Silicon Valley realtor with 25+ years of experience, and taught the ins and outs of high-level business. This multi-year internship pushed me to adapt quickly, learn on the fly, and take on a wide range of roles — all of which required strong problem-solving skills and initiative.<br>
                                I started with cold calls to generate leads, as most salespeople do. I made calls daily, doing my best to mirror the buyer's energy and keep them engaged. It taught me a lot about communication, confidence, and how to read people in real-time.<br>
                                Eventually, I transitioned into the role of social media manager and content producer. I created and managed accounts on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, and LinkedIn under the Jake Gipson Team and Jake Gipson Estates brands. I also implemented Buffer to streamline our posting process, allowing us to schedule and automate content delivery across platforms.<br>
                                During this time, I organized studio sessions where we filmed and produced relevant content tailored to current trends. While my creativity was sometimes limited by branding needs, I learned how to consistently produce and publish content that resonated with audiences. I realized how important it was to research trends, understand target demographics, and track performance metrics to optimize reach and engagement.<br>
                                Through content creation, I picked up practical photography and real estate staging skills, which helped me better highlight listings in our posts. I also designed and built Jake Gipson’s website using Elementor and Kubio — a project that taught me a lot about UI/UX design, front-end development, and the importance of clear branding online.<br>
                                This internship gave me real exposure to high-level business, marketing strategy, and technical tools. More importantly, it helped me grow into a more adaptable, creative, and resourceful person — someone who can take on new challenges, learn quickly, and make a real impact.
