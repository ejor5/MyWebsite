                            <h3>Welcome to My Website Blog - 2/27/2025</h3>
                            <p>Welcome to my website blog! I have been working on this website for a few months, and I have officially purchased the domain and got the website in publishing functionality! I'm excited to share my journey, projects, and insights about technology and programming with you. Stay tuned for more updates and posts!</p>
                            <p>The creation of this website was a bit finnicky since I dreamt larger than I could afford. Initially this website had a video background of space as you see currently, but the cost for renting server space was too expensive for a college student. I looked into using an old computer to host my website, but with my background in security I understood the huge security risk that was and decided against it. GitHub pages offered limited but useful hosting, so that is what this is running on. I had initially built an interactive console that would be embedded into this website as a way to learn about me, but once again was limited by the constrictions of GitHub pages.</p>

                            <h3>Creation of Disneyland Live Stream App! 2/27/2025</h3>
                            <p>I have been wanting to make a linux based application that runs on my raspberry pi 3 for a long time, and the 24 hour Disneyland live stream seemed like a great opportunity. It took me about 2 weeks to fully develop since I have been so busy with school, here it is! I came across many difficulties trying to access the correct live stream from Howard Johnson, since the webcam creates a new stream at three different points throughout the day. To solve this problem, I thought outside of the box and used the solution of going to their website and pulling the link directly from them.</p>
                            <h3>Update 4/11/2025</h3>
                            <p>My raspberry pi really didn't have the RAM to run this application, so I went ahead an focused the application for Windows Based systems. You can run it now! Just click this post and it will take you to the GitHub. Download it and run DisneyDashboard.exe!</p>

                            <h3>Almaden Valley Athletic Club Web Scheduler 3/30/2025</h3>
                            <p>I work as a tennis scheduler at Almaden Valley Athletic club, and I have always hated painstakingly repeititve tasks. Each month, a tennis scheduler has to type in each student's name to enroll them. I decided to create a web scraping tool that would go through each class and each day, pull all names into a list, and sign them up for the next month automatically.</p>
