                            <h3>Backward Propagation Neural Network</h3>
                            <p>
                                This quarter-long project focused on the design and implementation of a fully functional neural network model using the backpropagation algorithm. Backpropagation is a cornerstone of modern machine learning, enabling neural networks to adjust weights through gradient descent and optimize performance during training.
                            </p>
                            <p>During this project, I gained hands-on experience in foundational machine learning concepts, including:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Feedforward and Backpropagation Algorithms:</strong> Implemented both the forward pass to compute predictions and the backward pass to minimize error through partial derivatives of the loss function.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Gradient Descent Optimization:</strong> Used mathematical principles like calculus to adjust weights and biases, achieving better accuracy over time.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Activation Functions:</strong> Explored functions such as ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh to introduce non-linearity into the model, enhancing its capacity to solve complex problems.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Overfitting Prevention:</strong> Applied techniques such as regularization and dropout to ensure the model generalized effectively to new data.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Matrix Operations and Vectorization:</strong> Optimized performance by implementing efficient matrix multiplications and vectorized computations using Python and libraries such as NumPy.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                This project was great exposure to core artificial intelligence concepts, including supervised learning, loss functions, and data normalization. Additionally, I improved my programming skills in Python while using best practices in code modularity, debugging, and unit testing to ensure robustness and scalability.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This experience gave me a solid understanding of how neural networks operate under the hood, which is very useful data science, software development, and security. The problem-solving skills required for this project were next-level and gave me a lot of real life experience in computer science.

                                    This project is a real-time dashboard application built using Python and Tkinter that displays live video from Disneyland along with updated ride wait times in a sleek and modern fullscreen interface. The application combines live data scraping, media streaming, and UI design to create a fun and interactive way to check park conditions remotely.
