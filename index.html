                            <h3>Backward Propagation Neural Network</h3>
                            <p>
                                This quarter-long project focused on the design and implementation of a fully functional neural network model using the backpropagation algorithm. Backpropagation is a cornerstone of modern machine learning, enabling neural networks to adjust weights through gradient descent and optimize performance during training.
                            </p>
                            <p>During this project, I gained hands-on experience in foundational machine learning concepts, including:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>- Feedforward and Backpropagation Algorithms:</strong> Implemented both the forward pass to compute predictions and the backward pass to minimize error through partial derivatives of the loss function.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>- Gradient Descent Optimization:</strong> Used mathematical principles like calculus to adjust weights and biases, achieving better accuracy over time.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>- Activation Functions:</strong> Explored functions such as ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh to introduce non-linearity into the model, enhancing its capacity to solve complex problems.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>- Overfitting Prevention:</strong> Applied techniques such as regularization and dropout to ensure the model generalized effectively to new data.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>- Matrix Operations and Vectorization:</strong> Optimized performance by implementing efficient matrix multiplications and vectorized computations using Python and libraries such as NumPy.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                The project provided practical exposure to implementing core artificial intelligence concepts, including supervised learning, loss functions, and data normalization. Additionally, I honed my programming skills in Python while leveraging best practices in code modularity, debugging, and unit testing to ensure robustness and scalability.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This experience gave me a solid understanding of how neural networks operate under the hood, which is highly relevant to fields like data science, software development, and AI research. It also equipped me with transferable problem-solving skills that align with the demands of a career in computer science.
